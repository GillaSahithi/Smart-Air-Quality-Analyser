Air is polluted day by day due to release of toxic gases by industries, vehicle 
emissions and increased concentration of harmful gases and particulate matter in 
atmosphere. If we breathe the same polluted air continuously, it affects to respiratory 
system and leads to long-term diseases. Particulate matter is one the most important 
parameter having the significant contribution to increase in air pollution. This creates 
a need for measurement and analysis of real time air quality monitoring so that 
appropriate decision can be taken in a timely period. People work at different places 
where we the air is polluted by different causes, they stay upto long time which badly 
effects if it is not intimated as there is no analysis of air quality.


 The project mainly focus on people who have a above lifestyle where they stay 
most of the time in indoors such as workplaces, laboratories. A proper air quality 
system should be prepared which can be easily carried anywhere which has proper 
analysis system. In this project we use Microcontroller Arduino UNO, gas sensors 
such as MQ 135, MQ 2, MQ 9, Temperature and humidity sensor, buzzer, LCD 
display, Solar cell, ESP8266.This project is made in less cost which is economical 
for everyone. The device shows the analysis in graph form which is easily 
understood by common people. It contains alerting system in the case of emergency.
The device should also give online diagnosis which is just similar to first-aid.
